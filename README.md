# OIBSIP

Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects I have just completed. Each of these projects demonstrates my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and programming. Below is a brief overview of each project.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Iris Flower Classification**
   - **Description:** Developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal dimensions.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
   - **Key Highlights:**
     - Data preprocessing and visualization
     - Built and evaluated models using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors
     - Achieved an accuracy of X% (replace with actual metric)

### 2. **Car Price Prediction**
   - **Description:** Predicted car prices using regression models with feature engineering and outlier analysis.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, NumPy, Statsmodels, Seaborn
   - **Key Highlights:**
     - Handled missing data and engineered new features
     - Identified and managed outliers for improved model accuracy
     - Achieved X% accuracy (replace with actual metric)

### 3. **Spam Email Detection**
   - **Description:** Built a classification model to detect spam emails based on email content.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
   - **Key Highlights:**
     - Performed text preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal
     - Used TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
     - Implemented and evaluated models such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines
     - Achieved X% precision and recall (replace with actual metrics)
